# GrayOS Technique Clustering Problem

## Story

Radiation therapy machines require different setups for different cancer types. Grouping similar treatments together minimizes machine reconfiguration. Managers want a visual way to see their scheduled appointments and to preview how clustering appointments with similar setups saves time.

## Goal

Build a UI that displays which appointments would be efficiently clustered, showing a before and after of the schedule. The before view shows all current appointments as scheduled. The after view shows the proposed clustering, highlighting changes and grouping appointments visually.
